# What is this repo?
Hi! This repo is a collection of my various coding projects. It is broken down into three sections (a) my thesis code (and datasets for replication!), (b) my LSE coding assessments, and (c) my SSE final data science assessment. 

## (a) Thesis Code
The code for my thesis is broken down into *two* Jupyter codebooks. 
- For validating preprocessing, you can download the raw data file from **Appendix A** and run the code from any Jupyter terminal (just change file path!).
- If you want to jump straight into verifying the analysis results, the cleaned final dataset is also available in **Appendix A**, which you can use to run the models from Study 1, 2 and 3.

## (b) LSE Coding Assessments
My coursework at LSE is very stats/programming heavy (despite seeming like a qualitative degree!) Files will be updated on a continuous basis, but here is a brief overview of the modules and programming languages:
1. DS202: Python (covers Machine Learning, Classification/Regression models, Supervised/Unsupervised Learning, and some text analysis)
2. PB130, PB230: R (covers all the fundamentals of R, plus regressions, multilevel models and some basic machine learning (supervised learning).

## (c) SSE Coding Assessment
I undertook a Masters' level coursework at SSE (BE903: Data Science for Business). It covered machine learning and fundamentals of deep learning in Python, along with text analysis. The final project was an individual assessment that required us to predict house prices in Stockholm based on historic data, requiring me to do significant feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning. 

The Jupyter notebook contains raw code, while the json file contains the final predicted scores. For a full breakdown of what I did, you can read my report which is also in the same folder.

## What I'll be adding:
This repo is a work in progress. In the coming weeks, I'll be adding code from my independent research projects and group research projects conducted over the years + the datasets. 

[Note: I taught myself NLP and sentiment classification/quantitative text analysis + advanced data visualisation (packages such as SweetViz, Autoviz, Plotly) - and used these for my projects, so sharing the code + datasets would make it easier to verify the validity of the results/replicate these studies.]
